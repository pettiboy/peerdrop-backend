# PeerDrop WebSocket Integration Guide

## Available Endpoints

1. Create New Session:

   ```
   GET ws://your-server/ws/chat
   ```

2. Join Existing Session:
   ```
   GET ws://your-server/ws/chat/{code}
   ```

## Protocol Flow

### 1. Creating a New Session

1. Connect to `/ws/chat`
2. Server responds with a session code
3. Share this code with the peer who wants to join

Example sequence:

```
Client → Server: WebSocket connection to /ws/chat
Server → Client: "ABC123" (session code)
[Wait for peer to join]
Server → Client: "the other guy joined"
```

### 2. Joining an Existing Session

1. Get session code from peer
2. Connect to `/ws/chat/{code}`
3. Both peers can now exchange messages

Example sequence:

```
Client → Server: WebSocket connection to /ws/chat/ABC123
Server → Original Client: "the other guy joined"
Server → Joining Client: "ABC123" (confirms session code)
```

### 3. Message Exchange

After connection, both peers can:

- Send text messages
- Receive text messages from the other peer
- Messages are delivered in order
- Only text messages are supported

## Message Format

### Sending Messages

- Send plain text through WebSocket
- No special formatting required
- No message type indicators needed

### Receiving Messages

1. Session Code Message:

   - First message received after connection
   - Contains the session code string

2. Peer Join Notification:

   - Message: "the other guy joined"
   - Indicates successful peer connection

3. Regular Messages:
   - Plain text messages from peer
   - Exactly as sent by the other peer

## Example Sequences

### Creating a Session:

```
1. → Connect to /ws/chat
2. ← Receive "XYZ789" (session code)
3. ← Receive "the other guy joined" (when peer connects)
4. → Send "Hello!"
5. ← Receive messages from peer
```

### Joining a Session:

```
1. → Connect to /ws/chat/XYZ789
2. ← Receive "XYZ789" (confirmation)
3. → Send "Hi there!"
4. ← Receive messages from peer
```

## Connection States

1. **Initial Connection**

   - WebSocket connects
   - Session code received
   - Ready for peer

2. **Peer Connected**

   - "the other guy joined" received
   - Full communication possible
   - Messages flow both ways

3. **Disconnection**
   - WebSocket closes
   - Session ends
   - Reconnection requires new session

## Limitations

1. **Session**

   - Maximum 2 peers per session
   - No persistent history
   - Sessions expire on disconnect

2. **Messages**

   - Text only
   - No message size limit
   - No guaranteed delivery

3. **Connection**
   - No automatic reconnection
   - No connection status updates
   - No offline message queue

## Error Scenarios

1. **Invalid Session Code**

   - Connection will fail
   - WebSocket closes
   - Must create new session

2. **Full Session**

   - Connection will fail
   - WebSocket closes
   - Must wait or create new session

3. **Connection Loss**
   - No automatic recovery
   - Must create new session
   - No message persistence
